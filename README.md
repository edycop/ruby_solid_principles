# Ruby SOLID principles

This work is based on [Python SOLID principles](https://github.com/AldoFusterTurpin/Solid_Principles_Python) by Aldo Fuster on the [PyGeekle'2022](https://youtube.com/watch?v=2fgBKDT1j8k) Online Summit event.

## Requirements

- Ruby: 3.1.2
- RSpec: 3.11
- FactoryBot: 6.2.1
- Faker: 2.23
- 

## Execute the examples

Every SOLID principles has the 'wrong' path and the 'right' path, so to execute every example you need to enter to every path for each principle and run the specs (rspec-expectations), like this:

- cd solid_ruby/SRP/wrong/
- rspec rspec/user_spec.rb --profile
